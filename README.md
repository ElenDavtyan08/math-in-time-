# Timed Math Challenge
This is a little challenge for checking you speed in solving easy math problems. 
There are ten tasks which include addition, subtraction, multiplicationâ€¤ Numbers are chosen in a random way. \
If you solve the task incorrectly, it will continue to spawn until it gets the correct answer. \
At the end you will get a result that will show __how much time__ you have spent on solving the tasks.
### Moduls
In this little project I used random and time moduls, where I use random, for choosing numbers and time for final result.
### How run the program?
You can use any version of Python for running this program. To start the game you need to press enter\
